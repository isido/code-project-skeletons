# Code Project Skeletons

Some simple code project skeletons, with tests, if possible. Just in case I need to mob etc. quickly.

## Racket

Racket with rackunit. With Emacs, I've been using Geiser (http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/) but see https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/other-editors.html for more options.
